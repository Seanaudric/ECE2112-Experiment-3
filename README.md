# ECE2112-Experiment-3

This repository is for the Experiment 3 of my ECE2112 - Advanced Computer Programming and Algorithms course. The notebook uploaded contains Python codes that deal with different sample problems given.

## Given Problems

### Problem 1: Using knowledge obtained from the experiment and demonstrations: 
a) Load the corresponding .csv file into a data frame named cars using pandas.
b) Display the first five and last five rows of the resulting cars.

### PROBLEM 2: Using the dataframe cars in problem 1, extract the following information using subsetting, slicing and indexing operations.  
a) Display the first five rows with odd-numbered columns of cars. 
b) Display the row that contains the ‘Model’ of ‘Mazda RX4’. 
c) Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) the car model ‘Camaro Z28’ have. 
d) Determine how many cylinders (‘cyl’) and what gear type (‘gear’) do the car models ‘Mazda RX4 Wag’, ‘Ford Pantera L’ and ‘Honda Civic’ have. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* Anaconda Navigator
* Jupyter Notebook
* Any version of Windows/MacOS/Linus that can run the programs above

### Executing the program/s
* How to run the program
* In every code cell, press Shift + Enter to run that specific cell
* It is necessary to run "import numpy as np" as the python code is dependent on the pandas library
* It is also necessary to store the .csv file in the same folder to use the dataframe
